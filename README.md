# Week-10-11 HoneyPot

## HoneyPots Deployed: <br />
  - Dionaea
  
## Issues:
Installing MNH was an issue since I was missing some of the snesors. I had to delete my VM instances few times and had to install MNH multipletimes. I had to delete the MNH git and reclone it and install it again. That fixed the missing sensors issue.
